This project started out as a final project for my advanced java class. Learning JavaFXML wasn't required but 
I decided to go ahead and teach myself how to create a better user interface than the JavaFX that we learned in class. 
I also learned that some health clinics use multiple sites and desktop apps to manage their clinics. Its a basic program
but I learned how to make a better user experience and see the potential that java apps can become.


-------------------------------------------------USING THE PROGRAM---------------------------------------------------------

When you start up the program enter admin for the username and password for the password. From there you are directed to the
home window where you should be able to click on any of the buttons shown. If the new patient button is clicked then you will
be able to enter a new patient record which gets added to the new patient arraylist and the arraylist of whatever doctor the
patient is going to see. If the Patient Record button is clicked then the Records window opens, to search for a patient you
can enter the patient name or search by doctor. The doctor arraylists are sorted using comparator. Once the name is entered in 
the search bar, you can press the search button and the patients information will be displayed in the view below. If the patient
is selected in one of the doctor comboboxes their information is also diplayed in the view to the left. Back at the home page if
the Analysis Button is clicked it shows a graph with the correlation of the number of patients to doctor specialties. The graph is
updated every time a new patient is entered into the management system. Finally, if the Log Out Button is clicked then the window 
closes and the program ends.
