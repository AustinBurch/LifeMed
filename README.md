# MedLife


This project started out as a final project for my advanced java class. Learning JavaFXML wasn't required but 
I decided to go ahead and teach myself how to create a better user interface than the JavaFX that we learned in class. 
I also learned that some health clinics use multiple sites and desktop apps to manage their clinics. Its a basic program
but I learned how to make a better user experience and see the potential that java apps can become.
